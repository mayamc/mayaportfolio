# About 
#Hello!
#Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my technical writing portfolio.

Here's some quick info about me: I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Creative Writing. I have over four years of experience in content writing, copywriting, technical writing, and editing. (You can learn about me here.)

Since I recently transitioned to the IT industry, my tech writing experience is limited. I also signed a nondisclosure agreement in my previous job, so I can't share my tech writing outputs anywhere. I created this portfolio to address these gaps.

My writing samples include a process document, an installation guide, and a how-to guide. I'm currently working on a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page and a video script, and I plan to add them here once I finish.

I hope my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills. Please check my online CV or LinkedIn profile to learn more about my qualifications.
