# About 

Thank you for your interest and for taking the time to review my portfolio.

Here's some quick info about me: I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Electronics. I have over 17 years of experience in technical writing, content writing, UX writing, training documentation, and editing. 


My writing samples include a process document, an installation guide, and a how-to guide. I'm currently working on a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page and a video script, and I plan to add them here once I finish.

I hope my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills. Please check my online CV or LinkedIn profile to learn more about my qualifications.
