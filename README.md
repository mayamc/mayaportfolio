## About 

I'm an experienced technical writer, traning content creator, team leader, and user experience professional. I am a passionate advocate for users and for the design, development, and delivery of quality technical content.

My area of expertise includes producing quality technical documentation, context sensitive help, traning, tutorials, and user assistance resource provide users with the answers that they're looking for, when and where they need it, and with the right amount of detail. I'd love the opportunity to add my commitment, desire for continual improvement, and experience working on complex software to your technical writing team.

My writing samples include a process document, an installation guide, and a how-to guide. I'm currently working on a frequently asked questions (FAQs) page and a video script, and I plan to add them here once I finish.

I hope my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills. Please check my online CV or LinkedIn profile to learn more about my qualifications.
